# Hey there! Welcome to my Github page!

I'm Lucas Schleu√ü, a physics student at Heidelberg University specializing in computational galaxy formation. There, I worked on **numerical methods** for solving the **hydrodynamic equations** and Voronoi mesh generation algorithms, under Dylan Nelson.

Currently I'm a visiting student at ITC/CfA Harvard Smithsonian, refactoring the moment-based radiative transfer in **AREPO2**, with the goal to merge the CPU and GPU versions.

Anything related to numerics, high-performance computing and scientific simulations sparks my curiosity and drives my work.

Feel free to take a look at my projects or [reach out](mailto:lucas.schleuss@cfa.harvard.edu) if you'd like to connect.
