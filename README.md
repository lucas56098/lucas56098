# Lucas Schleuss

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, particularly in the context of hydrodynamics for astro-cosmological galaxy formation simulations.

## Research Interests:
- **Finite Volume (FV) Methods**
- **Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) Methods**
- **Hydrodynamics in Astro-Cosmological Simulations**
- **Galaxy Formation Modeling**

## Projects
Here are some of the key projects I've worked on:

- **Project 1:** [Link to project 1]
- **Project 2:** [Link to project 2]
- **Project 3:** [Link to project 3]
